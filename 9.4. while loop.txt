while loop: continue execution till condition true.

every loop has three parts:

1- initialization
2- condition
3- increment or decrement

a loop has must these three parts otherwise loop will not run.

initialization -- starting position
condition -- how long the loop to run
increment -- increase as loop once complete.
decrement -- decrease as loop once complete.

example: print 1 t0 10, take int i
then, initialization: i =0, condition i<=10, incr/decr = i++
